	Ø Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client.
	Ø Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really is who they claim to be, whereas authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

Vulnerabilities In Authentication Mechanisms
	• Vulnerabilities in password-based login 
	• Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication 
	• Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms 

	1) Password Based Login
	A) Brute-Force Attacks
	i.  An attacker uses a system of trial and error in an attempt to guess valid user credentials.
	ii. These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords.
	iii. Special attention should be paid to:
	- Status Codes
	- Error Messages
	- Response Times
	
	B) Username Enumeration
	An attacker is able to observe changes in the website's behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid.
	
	
Brute Force Protection
	- Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access if they make too many failed login attempts
	- Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many login attempts in quick succession
	- User rate limiting

Vulnerabilities In Multi-Factor Authentication
require users to prove their identity using multiple authentication factors.
A) Bypassing two-factor authentication
B) Flawed two-factor verification logic
C) Brute-forcing 2FA verification codes
